# 👋 Hi, I’m @maddoMaddz

🔍 I’m interested in bridging **biotech, data analytics, and social impact** through storytelling, strategy, and smart design. I use data to surface insights that drive real-world change—from optimizing sales performance to advancing rare earth sustainability and human dignity projects.

- SQL & MongoDB for data querying  
- Python for analytics workflows  
- Tableau + Power BI for dashboard storytelling  
- Figma for rapid app prototyping  
- Statistical Analysis & A/B Testing for evidence-based decision making  
- Business Process Analysis (AI automation, ESG integration, and digital transformation)

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Biotech data analysis projects
