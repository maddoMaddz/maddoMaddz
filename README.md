# 👋 Hi, I’m Maddz  

🎓 Recently graduated and stepping into the next chapter of my career, I bridge **biotech, data analytics, and social impact** through storytelling, strategy, and smart design.  

I use data not just to analyze the past, but to spark insights that drive **real-world change** — from optimizing sales performance to advancing rare earth sustainability and community-driven innovation.

## 🌱 What I’m Growing Into
- Mastering **SQL & MongoDB** for powerful data querying  
- Building analytics workflows with **Python**  
- Designing dashboards in **Tableau + Power BI** for storytelling  
- Experimenting with **Figma** for rapid app prototyping  
- Exploring **A/B Testing & Statistical Analysis** for evidence-based decision-making  
- Learning **Business Process Analysis** (AI automation, ESG integration, digital transformation)

## 🤝 Let’s Connect On
- **Biotech data analysis projects** where science meets strategy  
- **Community-driven tech initiatives** that put people first  
- **Fellowship & innovation pilots** backed by research and impact
